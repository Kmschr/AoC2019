# Kevin's 2019 Advent of Code Solutions
From the [Advent of Code Website](https://adventofcode.com/):
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## My goals for this year:
- Complete every challenge using C++ (with standard libraries)
- Get better at using git and managing a workspace
- Don't lookup solutions! (I had to look up a hint for day 12 part 2 so far)
